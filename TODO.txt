Priority:
- Audit the bwrap command in bwrap-files/start.sh
- The posix_spawnp EFAULT issue

Backlog:
- STG
- Multi-file playground
- Print service time in response
- Access to stackage LTS packages
  - https://ircbrowse.tomsmeding.com/day/lchaskell/2022/05/19?id=558067#trid558067
- Additional flags for Core output (-dsuppress-all?)
  - See suggestions in issue #23
- Button for code formatting using a formatter
- Stretch goal: ghci on the playground module?
  - Or maybe per-line eval mode?
    - Fancy rendering of stuff with a ToHTML instance or somesuch?
- Vim bindings for code pane?
  - Perhaps using this: https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.StateEffect%5Ereconfigure
- Download of compileable project zip (with minimal cabal file)
