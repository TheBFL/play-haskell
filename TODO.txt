Priority:
- Audit the bwrap command in bwrap-files/start.sh
- Measure cpu time, not clock time, for timeout
  - 'ulimit -t' is worthless, I have no clue who came up with that
  - sudo cgcreate -t tom:tom -g cpu:/kaaslimited
      # The -t doesn't seem to do anything?
    sudo cgset -r cpu.max='100000 100000' kaaslimited
      # to limit to 1 thread: use a maximum of 100000us per 100000us
    sudo cgexec -g cpu:kaaslimited --sticky start.sh
    sudo cgdelete cpu:kaaslimited
  - Can just (and should probably) create a new cgroup for every fresh container, let's not let things linger (and we need separate cgroups for the separate processes anyway)
- Make sure {-# OPTIONS -Wall #-} does something

Medium:
- Hotkey for Run
- Haskell syntax highlighting in codemirror
- STG

Backlog:
- Multi-file playground
- Print service time in response
- Access to stackage LTS packages
  - https://ircbrowse.tomsmeding.com/day/lchaskell/2022/05/19?id=558067#trid558067
- Additional flags for Core output (-dsuppress-all?)
- Button for code formatting using a formatter
- Stretch goal: ghci on the playground module?
- Different editor?
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor (doesn't support mobile browsers, uses some odd web workers)
- Vim bindings for code pane?
  - Perhaps using this: https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.StateEffect%5Ereconfigure
