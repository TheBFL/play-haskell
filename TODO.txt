Priority:
- Horizontally scalable backend
- Audit the bwrap command in bwrap-files/start.sh
- Limit output size
- Measure cpu time, not clock time, for timeout
- Single click to link from playground (instead of 3)

Medium:
- Hotkey for Run
- Haskell syntax highlighting in codemirror

Backlog:
- Print service time in response
- Access to stackage LTS packages
  - https://ircbrowse.tomsmeding.com/day/lchaskell/2022/05/19?id=558067#trid558067
- Additional flags for Core output (-dsuppress-all?)
- Button for code formatting using a formatter
- Stretch goal: ghci on the playground module?
- Different editor?
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor (doesn't support mobile browsers, uses some odd web workers)
- Vim bindings for code pane?
  - Perhaps using this: https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.StateEffect%5Ereconfigure
