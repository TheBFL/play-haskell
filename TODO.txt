Priority:

Medium:
- Audit the bwrap command in bwrap-files/start.sh
- Better CSS!
- Hotkey for Run
- Haskell syntax highlighting in codemirror

Backlog:
- Button for code formatting using a formatter
- Stretch goal: ghci on the playground module?
- Different editor?
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor (doesn't support mobile browsers, uses some odd web workers)
- Vim bindings for code pane?
  - Perhaps using this: https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.StateEffect%5Ereconfigure
